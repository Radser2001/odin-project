    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>

      <li>1 (16 ounce) package cold, prepared pizza dough</li>

      <li>4 ounces provolone cheese, diced</li>

      <li>¾ cup cooked, crumbled Italian sausage</li>

      <li>½ cup cooked, diced sweet peppers</li>

      <li>4 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>

      <li>½ cup prepared pizza sauce</li>

      <li>¾ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="padding-top: 2rem; padding-bottom: 1rem">Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
      Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Generously grease a
      12-cup standard muffin pan with 2 teaspoons oil.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Pick
      it up from the edges to make sure it's not stuck to the surface, then cut
      out twelve 4-inch circles. Reroll the dough to cut all 12 circles if
      necessary.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Place each circle into a prepared muffin cup, making sure it's centered.
      Press and push dough up the sides of the cups, getting close to, but not
      all the way up to the top. When all circles have been placed in the muffin
      pan, go around one more time to push and press on each one.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      Put 1 tablespoon provolone cheese into each cup, followed by 1 tablespoon
      cooked sausage and 2 teaspoons cooked peppers. Lightly press on the
      fillings to compress, then top with 1 rounded tablespoon mozzarella cheese
      and 2 tablespoons pizza sauce, pushing the sauce down gently into the
      fillings; it's okay that the fillings will be slightly higher than the
      pan. Sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese generously over top.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
      Bake in the upper center of the preheated oven until the tops are
      beautifully browned, 30 to 35 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>
      Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes. Go around
      the edge of each muffin with a knife, then use a fork or small spatula to
      remove from the pan.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>
      Let cool on a rack for a few minutes, then garnish with parsley and serve.
